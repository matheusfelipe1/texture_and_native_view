# Integrating Native Content in Flutter: Texture and Native View in Detail

## **Description:**

This project demonstrates the integration of native Android and iOS content into Flutter applications, exploring the "Texture" and "Native View" techniques. It serves as a practical guide for developers who want to incorporate platform-specific resources into their Flutter applications, such as native maps, high-performance videos, or any other element that requires platform power. This project accompanies the article published on Medium: [Integrating Native Content in Flutter: Texture and Native View in Detail](https://medium.com/@matheusfel13/integrando-conte%C3%BAdo-nativo-no-flutter-texture-e-native-view-em-detalhes-6523b071868f).

### **Concepts Covered**

* **Texture:**
    * A way to display native content as a texture within the Flutter environment.
    * Ideal for rendering videos, games, or any content that requires high performance.
    * Allows greater control over the appearance and behavior of native content.
    * Basically, it renders the native content onto a texture that Flutter can display, like an image.
* **Native View:**
    * A way to embed native views directly into the Flutter interface.
    * Ideal for integrating complex native components, such as maps or camera views.
    * Offers deeper integration with the native platform.
    * Basically, it creates a native view that is inserted into the Flutter widget tree.

### **Project Objectives**

* Provide practical examples of how to use "Texture" and "Native View" in Flutter applications.
* Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each technique.
* Help developers choose the right tool for each native integration scenario.
* Facilitate understanding of how native content integration works in Flutter.
* Serve as a practical example for the article published on Medium.

### **Project Structure:**

The project is organized into separate Android and iOS modules, each demonstrating the implementation of "Texture" and "Native View." The Flutter code serves as the interface layer, communicating with the native modules to display the desired content.

### **How to Use**

1.  Clone the GitHub repository.
2.  Open the project in your favorite code editor (Android Studio, Xcode, VS Code).
3.  Run the application on an Android/iOS emulator or physical device.
4.  Explore the different native integration examples.
5.  Adapt the code to your specific needs.
